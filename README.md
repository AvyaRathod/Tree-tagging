## Growing a Greener Future, One Commit at a Time

### Problem statement:
- The NGO(Janagaruti) aims to increase green coverage in India by creating a platform that allows community members to tag trees and lakes on a map.
- Engaging community members empowers the community to actively contribute to environmental conservation efforts and creates a sense of ownership.
- The tagging system will help the government decide on tree plantation initiatives.
